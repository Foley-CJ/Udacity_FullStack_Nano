movieSite project contains 4 python files and 1 html file.

index_spin_up.py is the primary driver file.
This driver file is fed data from the media_data which is organized in classes
based upon the media classes.
The driver file heavily utilizes fresh_tomatoes.py to generate an html page which is served.

Future refactoring:  updating media_classes to accept TV shows and stem them from a single
parent class
